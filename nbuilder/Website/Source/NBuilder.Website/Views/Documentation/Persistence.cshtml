<h2>Persistence</h2>
    
<p>NBuilder also has another method called Persist(). It does the same thing as Build() but once the objects have been built it will call a predefined 
method to persist the objects somewhere.</p>
    
<p>The first thing you need to do is tell NBuilder how to persist objects of a certain type. You do this with the BuilderSetup class. (You can read more about 
BuilderSetup in the <a href="/Documentation/Configuration">configuration section</a>).</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    
BuilderSetup.SetCreatePersistenceMethod&lt;Product&gt;(productRepository.Create);
BuilderSetup.SetCreatePersistenceMethod&lt;IList&lt;Product&gt;&gt;(productRepository.CreateAll);
</pre>

<p>You only need to do this once per test run. Once this is done you simply call Persist() instead.</p>

<pre class="brush: csharp">
    
Builder&lt;Product&gt;.CreateNew().Persist();
</pre>
